Project Name: Design and Implementation of Data Privacy Protection System Based on Encryption Technology

 

Major: School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence ~ Software Engineering

Template Type: Science and Engineering

 

Main Content of Design:

With the rapid development of information technology, data has become one of the core assets of modern society. Whether it is personal privacy information, corporate trade secrets, or important national data, they are facing unprecedented security challenges. In the field of data privacy protection, encryption technology is widely regarded as one of the key means. Encryption technology converts data into unreadable ciphertext to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt and access data, thereby effectively preventing data from being stolen or tampered with during transmission and storage. Therefore, designing and implementing a data privacy protection system based on encryption technology has important practical significance.

 

System Functions:

1. User Authentication and Authorization: The system should have a user authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access and operate the data privacy protection system. Support multi-factor authentication, such as passwords, SMS verification codes, biometrics, etc.

2. Data encryption and decryption: The system should support multiple encryption algorithms (such as AES, RSA, ECC, etc.), and be able to encrypt, store and transmit user data to ensure that the data is not stolen or tampered with during transmission and storage.

3. Key management: The system should have a key generation, storage, distribution and update mechanism. The key should be stored securely and support regular updates and backups to prevent key leakage from causing data security issues.

4. Data access control: The support system should record user operations, including logs of data access, encryption, decryption and other operations. Support real-time monitoring and anomaly detection to promptly discover and handle potential security threats. Role-based access control.

5. Data auditing and monitoring: The system should record user operations, including logs of data access, encryption, decryption and other operations. Support real-time monitoring and anomaly detection to promptly discover and handle potential security threats.

6. Create system architecture, program design and development, system testing and improvement.

 

 

My Purpose:

1.     Purpose and significance

With the rapid development of information technology, the generation and use of data have shown explosive growth, especially in the context of big data and cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a global issue. Data leakage, abuse and unauthorized access pose a serious threat to personal privacy, corporate secrets and even national security. Therefore, it is particularly important to design and implement an efficient and secure data privacy protection system. Research on data privacy protection has gradually increased at home and abroad, mainly focusing on encryption technology, access control, data de-identification and other aspects. In terms of encryption technology, many researchers have proposed a variety of encryption algorithms, such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption and homomorphic encryption. These algorithms have their own advantages and disadvantages and are suitable for different scenarios. For example, homomorphic encryption can directly perform calculations on encrypted data, protecting data privacy without affecting data availability. In recent years, with the rise of blockchain technology, research on data privacy protection based on blockchain has also gradually increased. The decentralized nature of blockchain provides a new way to store and manage data securely, which can improve the transparency and security of data. In addition, attribute-based encryption (ABE), as a new type of encryption technology, allows users to control data access based on specific attributes, further enhancing privacy protection in the process of data sharing. Despite the rapid progress of research, in practical applications, how to balance data security and availability and how to improve the computational efficiency of encryption technology are still urgent problems to be solved. Therefore, designing a data privacy protection system based on encryption technology will not only help improve data security, but also help promote the innovation and application of related technologies.

 

2. Basic content, objectives, technical solutions and measures to be adopted in the study

System architecture design: The system will adopt a layered architecture, which is mainly divided into data acquisition layer, data storage layer, data processing layer and user access layer. The design of each layer will ensure the security and privacy protection of data throughout the life cycle.

Encryption mechanism: The system will adopt a combination of symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption to ensure the security of data in different states. Specifically, personal sensitive data will be symmetric encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), while key management will be protected by asymmetric encryption algorithms such as RSA & etc..

Access control: The attribute-based encryption (ABE) mechanism is introduced to achieve fine-grained access control of data. Based on the user's attributes, the system can dynamically generate keys to ensure that only users who meet specific conditions can access the corresponding data.

Data sharing and storage: Combined with blockchain technology, decentralized storage and sharing of data is realized. Data will be encrypted before being uploaded to the blockchain to ensure data integrity and privacy.

User interface: A user-friendly interface is designed to enable users to easily upload, share and access data. At the same time, the system will provide real-time monitoring and alarm mechanisms to improve data security.
