I want to design and implement a data privacy protection system based on encryption technology as my graduation project. Please design a complete project in a modern way based on the following information and code it from A to Z with a database and write how each function works (new functions can be added if necessary):

Project Name: Design and Implementation of Data Privacy Protection System Based on Encryption Technology

Major: School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence ~ Software Engineering
Template Type: Science and Engineering

Main Content of Design:
With the rapid development of information technology, data has become one of the core assets of modern society. Whether it is personal privacy information, corporate trade secrets, or important national data, they are facing unprecedented security challenges. In the field of data privacy protection, encryption technology is widely regarded as one of the key means. Encryption technology converts data into unreadable ciphertext to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt and access data, thereby effectively preventing data from being stolen or tampered with during transmission and storage. Therefore, designing and implementing a data privacy protection system based on encryption technology has important practical significance.

System Functions:
1. User Authentication and Authorization: The system should have a user authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access and operate the data privacy protection system. Support multi-factor authentication, such as passwords, SMS verification codes, biometrics, etc.
2. Data encryption and decryption: The system should support multiple encryption algorithms (such as AES, RSA, ECC, etc.), and be able to encrypt, store and transmit user data to ensure that the data is not stolen or tampered with during transmission and storage.
3. Key management: The system should have a key generation, storage, distribution and update mechanism. The key should be stored securely and support regular updates and backups to prevent key leakage from causing data security issues.
4. Data access control: The support system should record user operations, including logs of data access, encryption, decryption and other operations. Support real-time monitoring and anomaly detection to promptly discover and handle potential security threats. Role-based access control.
5. Data auditing and monitoring: The system should record user operations, including logs of data access, encryption, decryption and other operations. Support real-time monitoring and anomaly detection to promptly discover and handle potential security threats.
6. Create system architecture, program design and development, system testing and improvement.
